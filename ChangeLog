* Mon Dec 05 2016 Hubert Degaudenzi  <Hubert.Degaudenzi@unige.ch> 4.1-1
- New version of the documentation generation system
- Add backtrace feature. It displays the stack trace for the crashes. It equips
  the binary built ontop of the ElementsKernel/Program.h class and there is an
  example in the ElementsExamples module. This is especially helpful for the
  forensic study of production crashes.
- Fix valgrind issues for unbalanced new/delete of smart pointers
- Add python ElementsKernel.Temporary.TempEnv class for using a temporary
  environment that will be forgotten after the destruction of the instance.
- Add C++ Elements::TempEnv class that has to same function has the one above
  in python. Very useful for the creation of elaborate tests.
- Add 2 CMake options, SPHINX_BUILD_OPTIONS and SPHINX_APIDOC_OPTIONS ot be
  added to the CMAKEFLAGS environment variable if needed.
- Make the python and internal script compatible with python 3.
- Add script to generate <project>_INSTALL.h header file and python <project>_INSTALL.py
  module that contain the install location.
- Add full RPATH handling for the install location.
- Add a flag to activate C++14 (ELEMENTS_CPP14). It is OFF by default.
- Fix the error reporting of the "make tests" command. Now it returns the exit
  code to the calling shell.
- Add a flag to ignore warnings issued by external included files (like Eigen3
  for example). The flag is called HIDE_SYSINC_WARNINGS and it uses -isystem instead
  of -I for the included external path. It is OFF by default.
- Add the possibility to pass boolean option to the python scripts.
  This is the redmine issue #2708 (Marco Frailis)
- Add the CXX_SUGGEST_OVERRIDE option. It warns about overriding virtual
  functions that are not marked with the override keyword.
- Add the possibility to add an offset for the install location at install time only (for experts only). .
- Add a pure C program example: ElementsExamples/src/CProgram/cutout.c
- Add extra arguments passing to the rpmbuild (RPMBUILD_EXTRA_ARGS).
- Numerous bug fixes and enhancements in the C++, Python and CMake libraries.
- Add a full description of the various Elements build flags to the Wiki.

* Tue Mar 22 2016 Hubert Degaudenzi  <Hubert.Degaudenzi@unige.ch> 4.0-1
- This release is foreseen for the Phosphoros version 0.5 project. It
  also include the first integration of the Sphinx/Doxygen implementation.
- Add FindCCache, FindDistCC, FindSphinx, FindValgrind, FindPlantUML CMake modules
- Implement the generation of both Doxygen and Sphinx documentation
- Add the ChangeLog content to the generated SPEC file. The ChangeLog file (this file)
  must be located at the root of the project.
- Add a simple SWIG Python/C++ generation example.
- Add new RemoveCppClass, RemovePythonModule, RemovePythonProgram,
  RemoveCppProgram scripts (Nicolas Morisset).
- Add the CFITSIO_IS_REENTRANT CMake variable. It is computed during the
  configuration and then can be used further in the CMakeLists.txt files
- Add a timeout feature for the pure python tests. This is done by adding the
  TEST_TIMEOUT argument in seconds to the elements_install_python_modules CMake function.
- Update the compilation flags to support security hardening. Please have a
  look at this page https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Harden_All_Packages 
  for more information.
- Fix the building of the RPMs file for a custom (general) build directory.
  It doesn't require that the build directory is placed inside the source directory.
- Make the dependency check between projects mandatory. It will break if there
  is an inconsistency in the tree of projects.
- Add global options to enable Doxygen (USE_DOXYGEN) and Sphinx (USE_SPHINX) for
  the automatic documentation generation. They are both ON by default. The is also
  an option for the generation of the Sphinx API documentation (USE_SPHINX_APIDOC)
  which is also ON by default. Please have a look at the user manual for more informations
  about the usage of these switches.
- Make the getAuxPathFile(file_name) python function generic. It can be used to
  locate resources pointed by the directory list in the ELEMENTS_AUX_PATH
  environment variable (Nicolas Morisset).
- Clean up of the main Elements Doxygen page.
- And many bug fixes.

* Tue Feb 09 2016 Hubert Degaudenzi <Hubert.Degaudenzi@unige.ch> 3.10-1
- This release is essentially an update for the release of the EDEN 1.2 version.
- Add CMake build support for various libraries and tools:
  - GSL (issue #1907)
  - HealpixCpp
  - WCS
  - FFTW
  - PyXB
  - Xsd
- Add trivial examples to check that the build works if the following libraries
  are found (their build is conditional):
  - Eigen
  - FFTW
  - GSL
  - HealpixCpp
  - WCS
  - Xerces
- Fix a few issues for the symbol visibility and CMake 3.3
- Add full support for the GCC 5 compiler series.
- Cure redundant sub-namespaces.
- Make the Log4CPP dependency mandatory.

* Fri Jan 22 2016 Hubert Degaudenzi <Hubert.Degaudenzi@unige.ch> 3.9-1
- This is a release targeted for the ISDC December 2015 Phosphoros Workshop.
- This release is done together with the 1.14 version of the EuclidEnv standalone package
- Here is a short summary of the noticeable changes:
  - Implement the possibility of having generated aux directories (auxdir)
  - Add the main creation helper scripts: CreateElementsProject, AddElementsModule, AddCppProgram, AddCppClass, AddPythonProgram, AddPythonModule (Nicolas Morisset)
  - Fix the build for the MacPort distribution
